# General Folder Optimiser

## Description

Given that directly integrating ChatGPT with filesystems brings with it all kinds of security concerns and integrations may take a while to mature, another idea could be a GPT which takes and parses screenshots of a folder structure (for instance our very messy Gdrive at work).

GPT then makes suggestions for how you could organise and structure the filesystem better.
