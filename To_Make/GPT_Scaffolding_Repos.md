# GPT Scaffold Repos

## Description

I want to create 3 x repo templates to mirror the core modules in my NocoDB setup at the moment.

Those are:

- An inventory of custom GPTs
- A prompt library
- A knowlege base of prompt outputs

The 3 templates will be for my own "scaffolding" use and for anyone else who might find them helpful.
