# My To-Do List Item

Even with the help of snippets creating markdown files individually is a dumb approach although I'm liking the idea of open sourcing the to do list items that I can. Thinking of a better system that involves a little bit of scripting and a dab of keyboard macros (possibly a good use for my new Streamdeck!)
