# Github to B2 daily automated backups

## Description

I want to set up a daily automated backup script running at 00:00 (UTC).

The script will incrementally backup all my repos (public and private) to B2.

There are already some similar projects on Github and I will have a look at those.

But if I figure out anything useful will document.
