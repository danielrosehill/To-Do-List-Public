# Populate Custom GPTs Into Repo

## Description

Have a backlog of a couple of a few dozen custom GPTs to put into the repo.

In many cases the configs will need to be converted to JSON

While I'm at it will create a quick Python script for creating the skeleton I'm developing for indexing custom GPTs:

```
GPT Name
- Configs
-- Old_versions
- config.txt
- config.json
about.md
```

Also want to try out the VS Code extensions for automatically building out these skeletons in repos.
