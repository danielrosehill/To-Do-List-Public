# The Master GPT System

## Description

This is a very big and ongoing project but one which has already provided a huge amount of utility.

I'm getting to the point at which the basic taxonomy and backend is sound (of course which a lot of work that still needs to be done in cleaning up views, fields, relationships).

The next logical "step" is building out solid frontend elements: an Android app (must have!) and ideally tools for discrete and very essential functions to the overall system:

- Viewing environment for just reading the outputs
- Uncluttered writing environment for prompt engineering with minimal distractions
