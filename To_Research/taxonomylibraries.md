#  To look into: libraries for automated taxonomy creation

## Description

Played around with a few of the Hugging Face models with patchy results (almost certainly due to my own ignorance).

Next week hoping to delve more comprehensively into what's out there in terms of automated taxonomy creation (e.g. you specify a taxonomy you're working on populating and GPT suggests some ideas iteratively). Bookmarked a few interesting Python libraries.
